#   To create a list in Python, you can simply enclose a 
#   comma-separated sequence of items in square brackets

fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Kivi", "Grape"]

#   You can access individual elements
#   of a list by their index. In Python, indexing starts at 0, so the
#   first element of the list has an index of 0, the second has an 
#   index of 1, and so on. To access an element, simply use its index
#   in square brackets after the list name. 

print(fruits[3])

#   Slicing a List You can also extract a subset of elements from a list
#   using slicing. Slicing allows you to specify a range of indices to 
#   extract from the list. 
# 
#   To slice a list, use the following syntax: 
#   list_name[start_index:end_index]. 
#   
#   Note that the start_index is inclusive and the end_index is exclusive.
# 
#   For example, to slice our fruits list to extract the first three elements:
#   print(fruits[0:3])
