##Here is collection of notes from different learning sources

🌟 Computer programs use variables to remember important information   
🌟 A variable has a name and a value    
🌟 You can create a variable by connecting the name and the value with an equal sign =.
---
Strings in Python need to be surrounded by quotation marks. ->> "The Lord of the Rings"
---
Use quotation marks to tell Python that we are working with a piece of text data.
---
Strings can be stored in variables.   
Store the value "Apple" in the variable    
company ="Apple"
---
In Python, both single ' and double " quotes can be used to define strings.     
It doesn’t make a difference whether you choose double or single quotation marks.     
The quotation marks just need to match.
---
The code in computer programs are made of statements. Statements are the instructions     
for the computer to follow. Real programs can contain thousands of statements.
---
🌟 A piece of text is called a string     
🌟 Strings require quotation marks      
🌟 The print() statement is used to send a value to the screen.
---
By calling a Variable name you access the value that is stored in the Variable
---
🌟 Numerical values can be stored in variables     
🌟 You can access the value stored in a variable by calling its name      
🌟 Numerical data should not be surrounded by quotation marks.
---
**input**
>Get data from the “outside world”. This might be reading data from a
file, or even some kind of sensor like a microphone or GPS. In our initial
programs, our input will come from the user typing data on the keyboard.
---
**output**
>Display the results of the program on a screen or store them in a file or
perhaps write them to a device like a speaker to play music or speak text.
---
🌟 You can run calculations using the values stored in variables     
🌟 You can store the result of a calculation in a variable     
🌟 Updating the value of a variable is called reassigning a variable.
---
The computer reads and executes instructions line by line, from top       
to bottom. The execution of the program will be interrupted at the first error encountered.
---
🌟 Errors in code are known as bugs      
🌟 Code is executed line by line from top to bottom     
🌟 Code execution is interrupted by bugs.
---
🌟 You can add comments to your code with the hash symbol #     
🌟 Python is a case-sensitive language      
🌟 Snake case is the best practice when creating multi-word variable names.
---
🌟 spaces are not allowed in variable names     
🌟 a variable name cannot start with a number      
🌟 best practices can help you avoid errors.    
---
🌟 inputs and outputs help machines communicate with the outside world     
🌟 the input() instruction allows the user to enter a value into your program      
🌟 the print() instruction is used to generate an output.
---
🌟 data types tell computers how to store, process and operate different types of data     
🌟 string is the data type for text      
🌟 integer and float are data types for numbers.
---
🌟 the type() instruction is used to check the data type       
🌟 the division of two integers always produces a float.
