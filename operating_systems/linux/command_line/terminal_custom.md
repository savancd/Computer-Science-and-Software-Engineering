### My goal is to completely customize terminal in look and functionality.

> 1: I started from base look of terminal:

![terminal_base_look](../../.img/terminal_base_look.png)


> 2: Edited the colors

![terminal_colors](../../.img/terminal_colors.png)

> 3: Setting the transparency

![terminal_transparency](../../.img/terminal_transparency.png)

> 4: After setting-up the transparency I decided to install starship to customize command prompt with *starship* and *snaps*
>
>> On Debian snap can be installed from the command line
```
apt install snapd
```

> After snap install I installed starship
```
snap install starship --edge
```

> 5: Restarted the Terminal to get updated
