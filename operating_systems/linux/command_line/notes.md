## Terminal

> When using a graphical user interface (GUI), we need program called a terminal
to interact with the shell.
>
>> KDE uses konsole and GNOME uses gnome-terminal, it's
called “terminal” on our menu.

```
[me@linuxbox ~]$
```

> This above is a shell prompt and it will appear whenever the shell is ready to accept in-
put. It may vary in appearance somewhat depending on the distribution, and it will
typically include your username@machinename, followed by the current working directory
and a dollar sign.
>
#### **NOTE**
> It can also be customized to look differently like in my machine example:

```
root in /root ❯
```

## Command History
> When pressing the ***up-arrow key***, you can see that the previous command
```
***some command***
```
reappears after the prompt.
>
>> This is called ***command history***. Most Linux distributions re-
member the last 1000 commands by default. Press the ***down-arrow key*** and the previous
command disappears.


>  Trying simple command *date*, which displays the current time and date.
>
```
root in /root ❯ **date**
```
