# /usr/local

> The ***/usr/local*** tree is where is the programs that are not included with the distribution but are intended for system-wide use are installed.  Programs compiled from source code are normally installed in ***/usr/local/bin***. On a newly installed Linux system, this tree exists, but it will be empty until system admin something puts in it.
