> The ***/proc*** directory is special. It's not a real file system in the sense of files stored on the system. Rather it is a virtual file system maintained by Linux kernel. The ***files*** it contains are peepholes into kertnel itself. The files are readable and will give us a picture of how kernel sees the computer.
