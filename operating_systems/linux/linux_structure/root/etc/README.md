# /etc
### The ***etc*** directory contains all of the system-wide configuration files. It also contains a collection of shell scripts that start each other of the system services at the boot time. Everything in this directory should be readable text.


> Interesting files: While everything in ***/etc*** is interesting, here is some of all-time favorite:
* /etc/crontab, a file that defines when automated jobs will run.
* /etc/fstab, a table of storage devices and their associated mount points.
* /etc/passwd, a list of user accounts.
