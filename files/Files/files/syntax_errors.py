#   One of the error that you might see with some regularity is a syntax error.
#   A syntax error occurs when Python doesn't recognize a section of the code.


message = "One of the Python's strenghts is its diverse community"
print(message)

#   If you use an apostrophe within single quotes, it will produce an error
message2 = 'One of the Python's strenghts is its diverse community'     

#   Error happen because Python interprets everything between the first single quote and the apostrophe as a string

#   If you use single quotes, python can't identify where the string should end
