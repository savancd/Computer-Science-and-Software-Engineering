#   In this example, we ask Python to remember the value six and use the label x so
#   we can retrieve the value later. We verify that Python has actually remembered
#   the value using print. Then we ask Python to retrieve x and multiply it by seven
#   and put the newly computed value in y. Then we ask Python to print out the
#   value currently in y.

x = 36
y = x * 7

print(y)
